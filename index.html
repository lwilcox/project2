      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Logan Wilcox and I am currently a 3rd year student at IIT
        pursuing my Bachelors in IT and Managment with a specialization in cyber
        security. I also plan on joining the coterminal program next semester and
        earning my masters in cyber forensics. I was born in Illinois and have lived in
        this state my whole life. I enjoy travelling, riding motorcycles, skateboarding,
        snowboarding, filming and editing videos, and working with computers. You can
        take a look at my professional resume and find out more about my personal
        interests by clicking the links labelled "resume" or "interests".
